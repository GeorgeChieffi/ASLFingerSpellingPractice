# ASLFingerSpellingPracticeWebsite
Uses a pre-trained detection model from Roboflow and accesses the users camera to detect ASL letters. Is used to reinforce ASL Fingerspelling learning without the need of a teacher or supervisor.

This website was built to teach new ASL learners how to fingerspell. Fingerspelling is one of the first things new signers learn and one of the hardest to be proficent in. I wanted to create this website for students to use as a learning tool. Students can use the site without the need for a teacher to proctor them.
