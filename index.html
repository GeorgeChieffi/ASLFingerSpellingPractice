            <h1>Welcome to ASL Fingerspelling Practice</h1>
            <p>This website was built to teach new ASL learners how to fingerspell. Fingerspelling is one of the first things new signers learn and one of the hardest to be proficent in. I wanted to create this website for students to use as a learning tool. Students can use the site without the need for a teacher to proctor them.
            </p>
            <h3>How to use</h3>
            <p>The website is very simple. all you need to do is give the website access to your webcam and start signing. The model detects the shape of your hand and does its best to give feedback as to what letter you are currently holding up.
                Remember to have good lighting specifically on your hand. The model is also more accurate if the background is that of a solid color such as white or black.
            </p>
